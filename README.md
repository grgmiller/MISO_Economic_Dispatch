# MISO_Economic_Dispatch
This project was completed as a final project for ENERES-254 Electric Power Systems taught by Duncan Callaway at UC Berkeley, Spring 2019. 

This paper applies the principles of power system control and operation to develop a deterministic economic dispatch algorithm that can be used to explore the impacts of several hypothetical interventions in the physical power system and its markets. Specifically, this paper will use the algorithm to simulate the short-run impact of carbon pricing and solar capacity expansion on the emissions, cost, and fuel mix of electricity within the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) balancing area.
